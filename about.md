Who am I?
I am just a Software Developer based in London, with the passion for programming and computers in general. I'm originally from Italy, and I moved to London in August 2013. I had always been attracted by this big capital, and at some point, I decided to quit my job and to move here to try something new.

I started developing years ago when I learned C and C++, initially by myself, and later at school/university. Nowadays I am mainly a Java developer, but, more than the language, I care about the quality of the code.
Being a follower of the Kaizen principles, I always try to improve myself, and I like to learn new things all the time. The only thing I feel I'm missing is exactly this...time! :-)

Outside the IT field, I like to do sports in general, with no specific preference, except maybe running.
What else? Oh yes, I've also started learning Japanese as an hobby!

Well, that's really it for me. I hope you didn't expect so much when cliking on this page. :-)
